SonicCraft: FPGA Audio Synthesizer

Overview:

Welcome to SonicCraft, an FPGA Audio Synthesizer project developed in May 2023. This project leverages the power of the Altera DE10-Lite board to implement a cutting-edge audio 
synthesizer. The focus of this endeavor was on creating a seamless and interactive audio experience, incorporating features such as a user-friendly VGA display, MIDI keyboard input, 
and real-time gameplay integration.

Key Features:

1. Hardware Implementation
The core of SonicCraft is programmed into the Altera DE10-Lite FPGA board. This hardware setup allows for efficient and real-time audio synthesis, providing a solid foundation for
the overall project.

3. VGA Display
A user-friendly VGA driver has been developed to enhance the visual experience. This includes scripts for parsing .MID files, enabling the generation of synchronized piano tiles
based on the loaded song. The VGA display enriches the user interface, making the synthesizer both visually engaging and functional.

5. MIDI Integration
Real-time interactivity is a key aspect of SonicCraft. Custom MIDI drivers have been developed in Eclipse to seamlessly integrate MIDI keyboard input. This not only allows users
to play the synthesizer using a MIDI keyboard but also opens up possibilities for creating an immersive audio synthesizer game.

7. Audio Chip Integration
Synchronous drivers have been crafted to establish communication between the FPGA processor and the SGTL5000 audio chip. This integration ensures high-quality audio output and
efficient control over the synthesizer's sound parameters.

9. Real-Time Interactive Gameplay
The project goes beyond traditional audio synthesizers by introducing real-time interactive gameplay. Users can engage with the synthesizer through MIDI keyboard input, creating
a dynamic and enjoyable experience.

Usage Instructions:

To experience SonicCraft, follow these steps:

Load the project onto the Altera DE10-Lite board.
Connect a MIDI keyboard for interactive control.
Enjoy the immersive audio synthesis and interactive gameplay.
